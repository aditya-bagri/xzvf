"Treasure of Love" is a song by George Jones. It was released as a single on Mercury Records and reached No. 6 on the US country chart in 1958.[citation needed]
Background[edit]
Jones composed "Treasure of Love" with J. P. Richardson, better known as the Big Bopper, who also wrote Jones' first No. 1 country hit "White Lightning." Jones biographer Bob Allen describes Jones' "languid, drawling" singing as "more reminiscent of the diphthong-twisting style of Oklahoma honky-tonk king Hank Thompson than anything he'd ever recorded."[1] The single's B-side, "If I Don't Love You (Grits Ain't Groceries)," became a minor hit, peaking at No. 29 on the charts.[citation needed]
