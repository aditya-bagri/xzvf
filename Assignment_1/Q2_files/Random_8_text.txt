Irritant were a progressive rock / heavy metal band from Gloucester, England, UK, formed in 2002.[1] They originally described themselves as an "independent hard rock band", and flirted with rap, but developed a blend of progressive metal and hard rock.[1] They cited among their influences Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Iron Maiden, Rush, Avenged Sevenfold, Guns 'n' Roses, AFI, 80s metal and late 60s progressive rock.[1][2]
Their 2007 single "Voice of the Siren", described by the BBC as a "gargantuan rock classic", was produced by Vic Coppersmith-Heaven (who previously worked with Black Sabbath, The Jam, and The Rolling Stones) and reached No. 70 on the UK Singles Chart.[3][4] They band split on 8 February 2008.
