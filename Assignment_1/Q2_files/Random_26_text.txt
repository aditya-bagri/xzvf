"Big Big Deal" is a single by British singer-songwriter Steve Harley, released as his debut solo single in 1974.[1] It did not appear on any album and would be the Harley's last release before his UK number one hit "Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)" in 1975.[2] "Big Big Deal" preceded the formation of a new Cockney Rebel band lineup.[3]

Background[edit]
"Big Big Deal" was written and produced by Harley. Following the split of the original Cockney Rebel line-up, Harley found himself without a band. During the period of auditioning new musicians, Harley decided to keep the momentum of Cockney Rebel's recent hit releases by releasing a solo single under his own name, without the Cockney Rebel tag. The single only involved Harley in the studio, along with original Cockney Rebel member Stuart Elliot on drums.[4] The song was recorded at AIR Studios in London, during September 1974.
Although the solo single failed to enter UK Top 100, it was successful in keeping Harley in the public eye, as a new line-up for Cockney Rebel was found later in 1974. Reportedly though the single was pulled not long after it went on sale. EMI Records were not dissuaded by the lack of success though, as Harley revealed in 2014: "The people at my record label, EMI, were right behind me. They believed I could find new band members without too much of a problem and continue on to a new level of success. They believed it wasn't a major stumbling block."[5]
Release[edit]
The single was released via 7" vinyl through EMI Records in the UK and Ireland,[6][7] as well as Belgium and Germany.[8] All releases of the single featured the b-side "Bed in the Corner" which was written by Harley and produced by Harley and Alan Parsons.[9] The b-side was taken from the Cockney Rebel album The Psychomodo, also from 1974.[10] No artwork was added to the UK or Irish release of the single, however the German version featured artwork with a close up photograph of Harley,[11] whilst the Belgian version had different artwork - highlighting a close up of Harley performing on stage, holding a guitar.[12] An identical promotional 7" vinyl was also released in the UK, which simply highlighted "Demo Records - Not for Resale" as the only difference from the main release.[13]
Following the original release, the track was unavailable on any other release for a few years, until it first appeared on the 1980 UK/European vinyl compilation The Best of Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel, released by EMI.[14] It next appeared as a bonus track on the 1992 EMI CD re-issue of the Cockney Rebel album The Psychomodo from 1974.[15] The track's next appearance was on disc one of the 2006 compilation The Cockney Rebel: A Steve Harley Anthology, released as a three-disc box-set by EMI.[16] In 2012, it appeared again on the Cockney Rebel compilation Cavaliers: An Anthology 1973-1974. The song appeared on disc two under the artist name Cockney Rebel feat. Steve Harley. On Disc 3, the full version of the track was added, titled "Big Big Deal (Full Version)" which is approximately a minute longer than the original version. This full version was previously unreleased.[17]
Promotion[edit]
No music video was created for the single, and limited promotion was given overall, although Harley did perform the track, and the "Bed in the Corner" b-side, live on the UK Kid Jensen 45 TV Show on 24 October 1974.[18][19]
A music advert to promote the single was released in Melody Maker on 9 November 1974, which noted the single as Harley's "first solo single". The advert also promoted both Cockney Rebel albums in the bottom half of the A4 page.[20]
The Cockney Rebel band, including Yvonne Keeley and Patricia Paay on backing vocals, performed the song live on the Autumn Tour dates of 1974.

Critical reception[edit]
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic had highlighted "Big Big Deal" as a standout track on the Cavaliers: An Anthology 1973-1974 compilation by labeling it an AMG Pick Track.[17]
In the Look-In Magazine of 14 December 1974, where Harley was pictured on the front cover, an article/interview with Harley was published. The author/interviewer spoke of the "Big Big Deal" single, stating "The latest single, "Big Big Deal" is written, produced and performed by Steve, and the new group's not on it. It's a sign of his individuality and talent, and he's worked hard to get where he is."[21]
