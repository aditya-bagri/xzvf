Other states[edit]

 Antarctica as a whole had no government and no permanent population. Seven states claimed portions of Antarctica and five of these had reciprocally recognised one another's claims.[1] These claims, which were regulated by the Antarctic Treaty System, were neither recognised nor disputed by any other signatory state.[2]
 The European Union was a sui generis supranational organisation which had 12 (later 15) member states. The member states had transferred a measure of their legislative, executive, and judicial powers to the institutions of the EU, and as such the EU had some elements of sovereignty, without generally being considered a sovereign state. The European Union did not claim to be a sovereign state and had only limited capacity for relations with other states.
 The Sovereign Military Order of Malta was an entity claiming sovereignty and a United Nations observer. The order had bi-lateral diplomatic relations with a large number of states, but had no territory other than extraterritorial areas within Rome.[3] The order's Constitution stated: "The Order is a subject of international law and exercises sovereign functions." [4] Although the order frequently asserted its sovereignty, it did not claim to be a sovereign state. It lacked a defined territory. Since all its members were citizens of other states, almost all of them lived in their native countries, and those who resided in the order's extraterritorial properties in Rome did so only in connection with their official duties, the order lacked the characteristic of having a permanent population.
