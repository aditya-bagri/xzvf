Seeking Alpha is a crowd-sourced content service for financial markets.[1] Articles and research covers a broad range of stocks, asset classes, ETFs and investment strategies. In contrast to other equity research platforms, insight is provided by contributor base of investors and industry experts (buy side) rather than sell side.[2][3] Seeking Alpha was founded in 2004 by former Wall Street analyst David Jackson.[4] The company reports it has distribution partnerships with MSN Money, CNBC, Yahoo! Finance, MarketWatch, NASDAQ and TheStreet, [5] but Yahoo Finance ended its relationship with Seeking Alpha on July 28, 2014.[6] [7]
As of February 2014, the firm had 3 million registered users, and attracted 8 million unique viewers a month.[8][9]

Contributors[edit]
The firm derives its content from independent contributors who sign up to the site. Base payment is $35 plus $10/CPM (1,000 page-views). For high-quality analysis of stocks that otherwise lack good research, the firm has three additional payment tiers, from $150 to $500 per article.[10] Finally, two articles are selected each week for a $2,500 "outstanding performance" prize on the basis of how well the stock idea played out.
Its articles are published as Premium articles, Standard articles, and Instablogs. Standard articles are allowed to be published elsewhere, and are unpaid, but also undergo a selection process. Instablogs are published instantly and with no pay.[11] In 2011, the firm is estimated to have paid its approximately 550 Premium contributors $1.2 million.[12]
The Wisdom of Crowds[edit]
In 2014, the Review of Financial Studies published, Wisdom of Crowds: The Value of Stock Opinions Transmitted Through Social Media. Researchers from City University of Hong Kong, Purdue University and Georgia Institute of Technology analyzed approximately 100,000 Seeking Alpha articles and commentary published between 2005 and 2012. The researchers looked at the ability of Seeking Alpha articles to predict not only future stock returns, but also future earnings surprises. Findings included[clarification needed] that Articles and comments on Seeking Alpha predicted stock returns over every time-frame examined: three months, six months, one year and three years.[2][13]
Reception[edit]
In 2013, WIRED magazine named Seeking Alpha one of its, "…core nutrients of a good data diet." WIRED: 101 Signals. In 2007, Seeking Alpha was the recipient of Forbes' Best of the Web Award[14] and was selected by Kiplinger's as its pick for Best Investment Informant.[15] In 2011 Seeking Alpha was listed as #1 in Inc. magazine's list of Essential Economic blogs.[16]
