Donald Andrew Grinde, Jr., a professor at the University at Buffalo, New York, is noted for his scholarship and writing on Native American issues. Along with his work in Native American studies he teaches multiple core classes. One of these being UGC 111 (World Civilization 1) here the class is taught as a team. The Teaching Assistants provide extra assistance and grade their students assignments and tests. Grinde also is responsible for this along with providing the lecture for the classes.
As far as performance for his lecturing skills go his track record is on the negative side. An anonymous student once said, "I don't understand how he got employed". On ratemyprofessor.com, a site were students review their professors, there are mainly negative reviews and the only positive trend is that Grinde provides answers to tests. Overall the opinion of his students remains sunstantially negative for the time being.
He served as a thesis adviser for Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, former Prime Minister of Somalia.[1]
