Club career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Rahmati started his professional career with Fajr Sepasi in 2000, he stayed for four years at the club and made 40 appearances before transferring to Sepahan. After only one season with Sepahan, Rahmati again transferred, this time to Esteghlal. Although he had good performance in the Esteghlal squad, Vahid Talebloo had better performances and he proved himself as the number one keeper for Esteghlal.
Mes Kerman[edit]
Rahmati again left this time to Mes Kerman where he played very well. He continued performing well in Mes and helped the club qualify for the AFC Champions League for the first time in the club's history. Persepolis showed some interest on him but he reject the bid.
Sepahan[edit]
On 14 July 2009, Rahmati signed a two-year contract with Sepahan for an approximate sum of $450,000 turning down an offer from Norwegian giants Rosenborg BK. At Sepahan he was the first choice keeper for the entire season and one of the most important players that helped the club win the league. He repeated the same feat with Sepahan the next season, he was regarded as the league's best goalkeeper after his performances with Sepahan.
Esteghlal[edit]
He joined Esteghlal in July 2011 where he won the Hazfi Cup in the first season. He extended his contract for another season on 18 June 2012. On 12 April 2013, Rahmati achieved a recorded twenty-four clean sheets, equalling with Iker Casillas in a season. He also helped his team to win league title after four years. At the end of the season, he extended his contract with the club. After the retirement of Farhad Majidi, Rahmati was named as Esteghlal's captain.
Paykan[edit]
On 18 June 2014, Rahmati left Esteghlal and joined Paykan for $1.5 million, signing a two-year contract. He played his first match for Paykan in 3-4 home loss to Tractor Sazi Tabriz F.C in 2014 Shohada Cup
Return to Esteghlal[edit]
On 29 June 2015, Rahmati returned to his former club Esteghlal on a one-year contract.[2]

International career[edit]
He was part of the team in 2004 AFC Asian Cup but he did not play any match. He won the 2004 West Asian Football Federation Championship with Team Melli. He was again part of the team in 2007 AFC Asian Cup but he did not play any match again. Since the start of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, he has been the number one keeper for Team Melli. He also played for Team Melli in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification. He had been one of the best players for Team melli in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification and 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification with his saves played an important role.He was the first choice keeper in West Asian Football Federation Championship 2010 and 2011 Asian Cup.
Retirement[edit]
On 20 January 2013, Mehdi Rahmati announced his temporary retirement from the national team, he stated in an interview “Maybe I cannot be at the service of Team Melli, so I temporarily announce my resignation.” He added, “Due to some problems, I prefer not to say anything for the time being, but I have to say just one thing that I am not at the service of Team Melli for a while.” [3]
After the announcement Team Melli Coach Carlos Queiroz made a comment that he respect Rahmati's decision and will not invite him any more. Many in the Iranian FA tried to convince him to invite Rahmati again but Queiroz said that he was not involved in the decision and he can not see any reason to negotiate this matter with Rahmati. In March 2013 Rahmati made a comment that Queiroz should not be the coach of Iran and the best he could do was to help as the assistant. At the end of the season Rahmati apologised to the Iranian people but not Queiroz personally in Navad. Before the final 3 matches in June 2013 for the World cup qualifications it was rumoured that the Iranian FA and Queiroz asked him to sign an apology letter provided by them which he refused. A month later in July 2013, Hadi Aghili revealed that Rahmati told him not to sign the apology and they will beg us to return after they lose the first match which did not happen. However Rahmati was present in Training Camp in October 2014 , but he was never called for an international match.

Rahmati is originally Iranian Azerbaijanis[4] from the East Azerbaijan Province and Osku city.[5]
