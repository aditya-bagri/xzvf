Foreign acts that performed on the festival include Ian Brown, Happy Mondays, Gary Moore, Dinosaur Jr., The Stooges, The Lemonheads, The Fall, Heavy Trash, Echo & the Bunnymen and The Rakes.

2007[edit]
Due to increased popularity and prominence, Apatin Brewery decided to organize the festival at the larger venue and include foreign acts in the lineup beside the Serbian rock acts. The festival was held at the Kalemegdan Fortress and lasted for three days, from September 7 to September 9.
The lineup featured Ian Brown, Happy Mondays, Gary Moore, Hladno Pivo, Let 3, Discipline A Kitschme, Partibrejkers, Plejboj, Darkwood Dub, Obojeni Program, Marčelo, Dado Topić & Time, Darko Rundek, and Laibach. As a special feature, the festival gave opportunity to young musicians to show their onstage ability.

The second night featured Strip, Shiroko, Majke, Discipline A Kitschme, The Lemonheads and Partibrejkers. This year the festival was raising awareness about environmental issues by promoting a tin recycling campaign with the motto "Reciklirajte i Vi!" ("You, too, should recycle!").

The motto of this year's festival was "Kad pijem, ne vozim" ("When I drink, I don't drive"), as a part of the cooperation between Serbian breweries and Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs.
