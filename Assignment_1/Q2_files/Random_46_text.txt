Awards[edit]
This film was nominated for the Goya Awards in 2002 in the categories of Best Picture, Best Actress (Victoria Abril) and Best Supporting Actor (Gael García Bernal).
The film earned Demián Bichir the "Best Bichir in a movie" MTV Movie Awards-Mexico in 2003.
Plot[edit]
In Heaven, the last ten years have been tough—Hell has been winning the battle between Good and Evil. The managers of Heaven receive a request by a mother to save her son's soul and see the possibility of winning the soul of a boxer named Manny (Demián Bichir) as an opportunity to shift the balance of power. Although Manny is severely in debt and is even thinking of suicide, Lola (Victoria Abril), an angel, is sent to Earth to take over the role of the boxer's wife. To counter this, Hell's manager Jack Davenport (Gael García Bernal) decides to send one of his more troublesome agents, Carmen (Penélope Cruz), who was a male ex-gangster punished by being converted into a waitress, to fight back by impersonating Manny's cousin. Though it starts out as a simple fight between heaven and hell for the soul of one man, a conspiracy in Hell and conflicting emotions interrupt the war between saints and sinners. Manny is overprotective of Lola and after looking through the porn magazines that Carmen reads, he suspects a relationship between Lola and Carmen. Suddenly Manny's soul becomes increasingly important and his weakened physical state creates a deadline by which he must go to Hell or Heaven. It is the job of the supernatural agents to tempt or save Manny. The obstinate womanizing boxer inconsistently shows signs of regret and change, for example when he writes a letter of apology to his mother but doesn't send it. His ups and downs make it a hard job for both Carmen and Lola.
