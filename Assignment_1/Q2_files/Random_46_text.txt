History[edit]
KASE-FM (100.7 MHz) debuted on March 30, 1969, then playing an automated "beautiful music" format.
Bill Mayne, KASE Program director at the time, recalled in a 2010 interview the Friday afternoon in 1981 KASE "came out of Mantovani and went into Waylon Jennings' 'Are You Ready for the Country,' ... and had every dentist's office, nursing home and doctor's office in the city of Austin calling to complain."[2]
The "Continuous Country" format became a hit with Austin listeners and since then has consistently been voted by radio general managers as one of the top twenty "Most Admired Stations" in America. It was the first station to win the "Station of the Year" award from the Country Music Association four times and was given its second Billboard Magazine "Station of the Year" award in 1997.[3]
Over the years KASE has dominated the Austin radio market along with sister station KVET-FM.[citation needed] According to Arbitron ratings, both stations consistently rank in the top three, sometimes #1 and #2. KASE has also been nominated for the CMA Large Market Station of the Year Award in 2011 and previous years.
