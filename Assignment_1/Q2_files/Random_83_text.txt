Career[edit]
Her recent albums feature Israeli songs, works of Shlomo Carlebach and songs from Judaism. She gives concerts in Israel and internationally and is in some ways the "Joan Baez" of Israel. Since she first electrified Israel with her heartfelt rendition of the then unknown song "Jerusalem of Gold", Natan has sung of the hope and the pain of the nation.
Since her historic performance in 1967, Natan has performed for countless audiences, in Israel and worldwide. Her unique voice holds the listeners in its spell, and every performance turns into a spontaneous sing-along.[citation needed]
In her 1999 CD Open Roads she included her versions of songs which are popular in Israel today, such as David D'Or's "Watch Over Us, Child" and Rami Kleinstein's hit, "Never-Ending Miracles."[1]
Natan accompanies herself on the guitar, as she sings Israeli songs, folk songs from around the world, Hassidic and Yiddish songs and songs of the Oriental Jewish community. Natan sings in different languages including Hebrew, English, French, Ladino and Spanish.
