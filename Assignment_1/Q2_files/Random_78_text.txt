Jim O'Brien (born February 2, 1947) is a former American football placekicker in the National Football League. He played for the Baltimore Colts from 1970 to 1972 and the Detroit Lions in 1973. He also played wide receiver, catching the bulk of his career passes during the 1972 season while still performing his kicking duties. His short career was less than stellar, posting a 55.6 percentage making 60 of 108 field goal attempts. His shining moment came in Super Bowl V where he kicked a 32 yard field goal with five seconds remaining in the game to give the Baltimore Colts the victory over the Dallas Cowboys 16-13. As a result, he appeared on NFL Top 10's One Shot Wonders at #9.[1]
O'Brien attended the University of Cincinnati, where he led the nation in scoring as a football senior. He also played freshman basketball at the University of Cincinnati. O'Brien attended Aiken High School in Cincinnati.
