Company history[edit]
In the early 1980s, Georg Eisath and Walter Rieder, operations managers at the Obereggen ski resort, imported a snow gun from America. Using this as a model, they constructed their first prototype. Together they founded the WI.TE company and started to produce machines in larger numbers. The first systems were built in Cortina (ITA), Falcade (ITA) and Valzoldana (ITA). In 1988, the first foreign offices was established with the Schneider company in Seefeld (AUT). In 1990, the Latemar M90 snow gun was launched on the market. After sales figures rose, Eisath and Rieder brought in salesman Erich Gummerer. Together they founded TechnoAlpin GmbH in 1990. In 1996, TechnoAlpin founded its first subsidiaries in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In 2005, the company was transformed into a joint stock company. Today the company has a global network of 7 subsidiaries and 18 trading partners. TechnoAlpin has 250 employees worldwide. In 2008/2009, company revenue broke the 100 million euro barrier for the first time.
