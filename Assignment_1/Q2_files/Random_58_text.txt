Around the movie[edit]
It reigns over PARAKKUM PAAVAI a suspense deserving of Alfred Hitchcock's movies !
It was the eighth and last adventure between MGR and director-producer, T.R.Ramanna.[3][4]
As it was the case on NALA NERAM for the producer Chinnappa Devar, PARAKKUM PAAVAI was for T.R.Ramanna, his first movie in color with the same MGR.
They enclosed their collaboration with MGR by a movie in color.
The movie starts by a credits in the form of cartoon create by Raki about 2 minutes and 40 seconds.
The director T.R.Ramanna magnificently exploited well the environment of the circus.[5]
The numbers (trapeze artists, jugglers, tamers, etc...) presents in the movie, are very well filmed by its camera.
The soundtrack of M.S.V. is always sublime.
K.J.Yésudass sings for the first time in a movie of MGR. Here, he lends his voice for the comedian J.P.Chandrababu in the song "Sugam Yethilae...".
