Early life and Education[edit]
Born and raised in Winnipeg, Andy was heavily influenced by the very strong radio market there, and the sensational local music scene. Late at night, if the signal was clear, he would frequently tune in WLS 890 in Chicago to listen to something different than what was offered in his hometown.

Further, Andy has been the Public Address Announcer / Voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs since their 1999-2000 season when the Toronto Maple Leafs moved to their new venue, the Air Canada Centre.
Psychedelic Psunday[edit]
Psychedelic Psunday airs on Toronto's Q107 every Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. The program consists entirely of music from the psychedelic era, spanning from 1965 to 1975. The program always begins with Alice Cooper's rendition of "Hello Hooray". Andy Frost, hosts from 12 noon to 6:00 p.m. At approximately 1:20 and 3:20, the game "Riffer Madness" is played. A riff from a song from the psychedelic era is played, and listeners can phone in and identify the song to win prizes.

The Post Game Show with Andy Frost[edit]
Andy is also the host of "The Post Game Show with Andy Frost" which airs after every Toronto Maple Leaf game on AM640 Toronto Radio. Andy invites listeners to call in and share their thoughts on the game. Many new and regular callers (such as Mike in Buffalo) frequent the show and provide commentary and analysis on the game. The show is full of in-depth commentary, analysis, updates on the night's action and listeners calls and comments. As AM 640 says, "It's the fans who have the final say". The show started in 1996 under the name "Leaf Talk". In January 2013, the show's title was changed to "The Post Game Show with Andy Frost" because AM 640 no longer has the broadcast rights for the Toronto Maple Leaf games.

Andy is also the host of a new show called "Frost on Ice". "Frost on Ice" airs on Friday at 5 PM on the new Bill Carroll's show on AM 640.
