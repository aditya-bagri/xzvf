Culture[edit]
Dundahera, being located on the Delhi-Haryana border, neighboring one of the earliest developed industrial areas has witnessed a sea change in the prevailing culture. Migrant laborers and workers employed by the industries surrounding the village had no other housing alternative than to look for cheap accommodation provided by the local people of Dundahera. Majority of the original native inhabitants of this village have left their ancestral homes to live in the urban sectors and they have rented out their homes to the laborers /lower working class thereby providing affordable accommodation to a large workforce; something which indeed was the duty of government policymakers or industrialists. The village has become a mixture of cultures as migrant labourers from all over India; mostly from eastern Indian states, nestle there for many years and their population has outnumbered the local population in terms of headcount. The village has lost all its ponds, green-belts, villagers' common places to the encroachment, acute commercialization and official apathy.
