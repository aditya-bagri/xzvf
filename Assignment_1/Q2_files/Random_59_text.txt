The lake was dammed and served as a reservoir for the old Husvik whaling station. It was named in 1990 by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after William C. Block, invertebrate zoologist, head of the British Antarctic Survey Terrestrial Zoology and Microbiology Section since 1976, who worked many summers on South Georgia and on Signy Island.
