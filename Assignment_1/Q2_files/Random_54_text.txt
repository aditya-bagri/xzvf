The Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights (German: Ludwig Boltzmann Institut für Menschenrechte, BIM) is a Vienna-based research institute affiliated with the Austrian Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft, that specializes in the area of human rights.
It was founded in 1992 by Felix Ermacora, Manfred Nowak and Hannes Tretter, all three Professors of Law at the University of Vienna. Felix Ermacora († 1995) served as its first director, since 2009, Manfred Nowak and Hannes Tretter are joint scientific directors. The Institute is located at Freyung 6 in the city center of Vienna/Austria. It cooperates with the Institut für Staats- und Verwaltungsrecht at the University of Vienna.
In 1993, the Institute organised and coordinated the activities of more than 3,000 NGO delegates during the World Conference on Human Rights.[1] In 2002, the Institute became a general mandate by the European Commission for the execution of twinning projects.[2] Since the establishment of the research platform Human Rights in the European Context in 2008, the Institute coordinates the research platform that brings together researchers of six faculties of the University of Vienna.[3]
