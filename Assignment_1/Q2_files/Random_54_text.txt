Ryan Shupe & the RubberBand is an American bluegrass group founded in the mid-1990s in Ogden, UT. The band's lineup comprises Ryan Shupe (fiddle, guitar, ukulele, mandolin, lead vocals), Roger Archibald (guitar, vocals), Ryan Tilby (bass guitar, string bass, banjo, vocals), Craig Miner (banjo, bouzouki, mandolin, guitar, vocals), and Nate Smeding (drums).[1] After recording four studio albums on their own independent record label, Ryan Shupe & The RubberBand were signed to Capitol Records in 2005.[1][2] Their first album for Capitol, 2005's Dream Big, produced a Top 40 hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs charts in its title track. The second single from the album, however, failed to chart, and the band was dropped from Capitol. In 2008, the band signed to Montage Music Group.

Formation and ideology[edit]
Ryan Shupe started playing the fiddle at age 5.[3] He played in various musical groups growing up starting with a group of talented 10 yr olds called the "PeeWee Pickers" who toured nationally.[4] His experiences in bands forming and then breaking up led him to the concept of a "rubber band". It would be elastic in members being able to rotate in and out without a name change or breaking a groove.[3] Since their formation they have become one of the most successful musical acts from the state of Utah among other acts such as SHeDAISY, Peter Breinholt, and Neon Trees. The band also made an appearance on the popular U.S. Television show Extreme Makeover: Home Edition on October 18, 2006 for a family in Logan, Utah.[5]
Sound[edit]
Though the band has played in traditionally country venues and festivals all over the United States (such as the Telluride Music Festival and Nashville, TN)[6][7] their music draws from various influences such as bluegrass and rock as well. They have been described as "a mix between Dave Matthews Band and Dixie Chicks without the political agenda."[7]
