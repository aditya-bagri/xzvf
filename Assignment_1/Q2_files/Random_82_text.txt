Gameplay[edit]
The basic gameplay is nearly identical to the previous Kiseki series entries with a few changes. The biggest change to the battle system and also counting as a brand new feature is the "Tactical Link System". The "Tactical Link" allow players follow up with three different kinds of link attacks, dealing additional damage and providing various other benefits. "Tactical Link" becomes a more useful asset to the player as the story progress and characters level up their "Link Levels" with other characters. As the link levels increase, you will obtain new link abilities such as healing the link partner or increase the CP gain of the partner. Another change is the Orbment system. Sen no Kiseki inherits the "Master Quartz" system from Ao no Kiseki. However, the Quartz system has been revamped. Sen no Kiseki does away with the sepith count associated with quartzes, which means orbal arts no longer depend on the overall sepith count on a single line but is instead based on the quartz you equip (EG: Equipping the Fire Bolt quartz allows your character to use the art Fire Bolt. Equipping HP1 only increases your HP and does not give you any arts because the sepith system is not in place). This game is also the first game in the series that was developed for the PS3. The game features 360 degree camera control, fully 3D character models, and voice conversations between characters on the overworld map, all of which are brand new features to the Kiseki series.[1] Players can transfer save data between the PlayStation 3 and Vita versions using the cross-save function.
Falcom has also introduced downloadable content to the game in forms of items that can be used in battle and cosmetic changes like everyday clothing for the characters. A "teaser site" for the game was released on December 20, 2012, and includes screenshots of the game.[6]
Plot[edit]
Trails of Cold Steel[edit]
The game takes place at the same time frame as Zero and Ao no Kiseki in the Erebonian Empire. The game's plot is centered around the newly formed special class "Class VII" in Thors Military Academy, composed of both aristocrats and normal Erebonian citizens. Class VII is the only class in the entire academy that does not segregate the two different social classes.
The game follows Class VII throughout their school year, mainly around the times when Class VII receive special field training that takes them all over Erebonia. Throughout their training across Erebonia, Class VII matures and casts aside their preconceptions of the two social classes and witness first hand the reality of the empire; The power struggle between the aristocracy led by the four noble houses, and the working class reformists led by Iron Blood Chancellor Osborne which threatens to lead to a civil war.
They also awaken Valimar, a knight-god (giant robot) sleeping under Thors. The story comes to a climax with the attempted assassination of Osbourne by the terrorist C who turns out to be the Thors student Crow, and a coup by the aristocracy, and ends with Thors being occupied by the coup forces lead by Crow piloting another knight-god, Ordine, leading into Trails of Cold Steel II.
Trails of Cold Steel II[edit]
Trails of Cold Steel II begins a month after the end of Trails of Cold Steel, with Rean having escaped with Valimar. He makes it to his hometown of Yumir where princess Alfin also escaped to, but she is kidnapped along with Rean's sister Elise. The rest of class VII has scattered over the country and he goes around gathering them and other Thors students, and after being given the airship Courageous by Olivier, uses Valimar to help civilians and look for Alfin and Elise.
The coup turns out to have been a plot by the leader of the Noble Alliance, lord Cheyenne, a descendant of the false emperor who had been defeated by emperor Dreichers, ancestor to the current imperial family, to gain power, and the Witch of the Abyss Vita, third apostle of Ouroboros, had been cooperating with him to fulfil the Illusion Flame project by making the Blaze Demon Castle appear and have the two knight-gods, Valimar and Ordine duel there.
When Ordine loses, however, Cheyenne awakens the red knight-god Testarossa and thus the End of Vermillion, a legendary demon-god once sealed by Dreichers. Rean and Crow cooperate to seal the End of Vermillion away again but Crow is killed in the process. At this point the Noble Alliance's advisor Rufus reveals himself to have been working for Osbourne all along, and Osbourne reveals himself to be alive and also Rean's father, before hijacking Ouroboros' Illusion Flame project.
There is also an epilogue in which the player controls Lloyd and Lixia from Zero and Ao no Kiseki, who are now part of the Crossbell resistance fighting the Erebonian occupation of the city-state, and they are confronted Rean, who now works for Osbourne and is known as the Gray Knight and a hero of the Erebonia who helped take Crossbell.
