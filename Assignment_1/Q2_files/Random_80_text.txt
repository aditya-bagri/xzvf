For the hamlet in England, see Kate's Bridge.
Katesbridge is a small hamlet in County Down, Northern Ireland. It is within the townland of Shannaghan,[1] just off the main route from Castlewellan to Banbridge, and 4.3 miles (7km) north of Rathfriland. The River Bann flows by the hamlet. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 135 people. It lies within the Banbridge District.
The hamlet is named after Kate McKay, who was born in Ballyroney in 1691 then went to live with her grandmother who is said to have owned the house where the workmen lodged when building the 18th-century bridge. It is because of Kate's kindness the workmen named the bridge after her, and the hamlet became known as Katesbridge.
