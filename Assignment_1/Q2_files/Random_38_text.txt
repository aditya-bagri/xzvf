History[edit]
Main article: History of the Northwest Arkansas Community College
NWACC was founded by voters in the Bentonville and Rogers Public School Districts on August 15, 1989, when they passed by a 65-percent margin a 3-mill property tax to support the new institution. NWACC opened its doors to 1,200 students in August 1990 and has in excess of approximately 8,000 college credit students (Spring 2013), making it one of the largest and fastest growing two-year college in Arkansas. An additional 6,000 students are served by through non-credit courses throughout the service area.[1]
In the early days, NWACC was known as the "College without walls" because it solved the problem of not having enough "bricks and mortar" funding to build classrooms by conducting classes in a variety of buildings throughout the community.
Faculty often had to transport learning materials, equipment, and even laboratory specimen in their personal vehicles from one location to another to meet with students.
Academics and Rankings[edit]
Northwest Arkansas Community College offers many areas of study leading to associate degrees.[2] NWACC also provides online classes. In 2006, NWACC was accepted as a participant in the Academic Quality Improvement Program (AQIP) by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). In October 2012 NWACC received a letter of reaffirmation of accreditation from HLC for duration of seven years. The HLC is an independent corporation and one of two commission members of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA), which is one of six regional institutional accreditors in the United States. The Higher Learning Commission accredits degree-granting, post-secondary educational institutions in the North Central region.[3]
