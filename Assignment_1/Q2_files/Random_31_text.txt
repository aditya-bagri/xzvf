Squadron Leader Nicola Elizabeth Smith (born c. 1969) is a retired British Royal Air Force officer. She was the first female RAF helicopter pilot and in 2002 she became the first female RAF officer to take command of a flying squadron.[1]

She was promoted flying officer on 15 January 1990[4] and in November 1990 she transferred from the Engineer Branch to the General Duties Branch as aircrew,[5] becoming one of the first female trainee pilots in the RAF. She was promoted flight lieutenant on 15 January 1992.[6] She went to RAF Swinderby for elementary flying training, returned to Cranwell for basic flying training,[1] and then went to RAF Shawbury, where she became the first woman in the RAF to qualify as a helicopter pilot in October 1992.[7][1][8]
She became a search and rescue pilot flying Westland Sea Kings, initially with 22 Squadron at RAF Valley on Anglesey and then with 202 Squadron at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, flying more than 250 missions.[1]
She was promoted squadron leader in 1999[1] and, after several ground jobs at Cranwell, she trained on Westland Wessex helicopters with 72 Squadron at RAF Aldergrove in Northern Ireland before being posted to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus to take command of 84 Squadron in 2002.[1][8]
