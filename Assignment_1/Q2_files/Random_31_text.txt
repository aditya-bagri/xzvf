The Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) is an initiative of the United States Department of State. It was begun in 2010 by President Barack Obama. YALI is a programme aimed at educating and networking young African leaders with activities including a fellowship to study in the United States for six weeks, follow-up resources, and student exchange programs.[1] In 2014, the program was expanded to include four regional "leadership centers" in Ghana, Kenya, Senegal and South Africa.[2]
500 participants in the program arrived in the United States on June 16, 2014.[3]
