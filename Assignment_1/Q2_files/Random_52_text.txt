Name[edit]
The name of the marque originates from the Maxus model of the defunct British commercial vehicle manufacturer LDV Group, following the acquisition of LDV's intellectual property by SAIC in 2010.[1]
History[edit]
The first Maxus product, the V80 van, was unveiled at the Auto Shanghai motor show in April 2011.[4] In the same month SAIC signed an agreement appointing the Malaysia-based WestStar group as the official distributor of the V80 for the Asia Pacific region.[5] The inauguration ceremony of the V80 was held in Shanghai on 29 June 2011.[6] The sale of Maxus vehicles in Australasia began in 2012, with distribution by the Australia-based WMC Group.[7] In September 2013 it was announced that Maxus vehicles would be sold in Thailand starting in 2014, as part of a deal between SAIC and SAIC Motor-CP Co.[8][9]
Maxus's second production model, the G10 MPV, went on sale in China in March 2014.[10]
Products[edit]
The current Maxus range comprises the following models:

V80 (light commercial van); and
G10 (seven-seat MPV).[11][10]
