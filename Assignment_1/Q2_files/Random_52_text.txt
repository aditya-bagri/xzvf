It is a story about a theatre group composed of talented and aspiring college and actors set out to have some fun. Somewhere along their journey, they realize that they want more. They want to touch the sky with their brilliance.
As in life, through their insecurities, anxieties, and dilemmas they find that friendship and dedication leads them to near heights, beyond the darkness that temporarily blinds each of them.
Aasma has a bunch of talented artists (Shubhashish, Seema Biswas, Hrishita, Raghuveer, Joy, Mushtaq and others) but then luck has been eluding them for quite a while. They are unable to get offers to play and this leads to more problems.
Then its main sponsor (Sachin Khedekar) backs out of the group and this makes them fall on to doldrums. From then on, the group tries to overcome several hurdles, and all of a sudden, it is discovered that the main character Shubh discovers that he is affected with HIV disease.
Here onwards, it is about how to live life normally even after facing such situations. How do they cope up with this situation forms the rest of the story.
