History[edit]
The two foundation stones set into the front wall of the church carry the date October 20th 1934.[2] The present church building was opened on 6 April 1935. The new building, financed by the sale of St Margarets Baptist Church, replaced Whitton Gospel Hall which had opened in 1881.[2]
The church's halls were opened in September 1968 on the site of an old tennis court. They replaced two previous halls, one of which was destroyed in a fire in 1966, and the other on a site which is now part of the church's car park.[2]
