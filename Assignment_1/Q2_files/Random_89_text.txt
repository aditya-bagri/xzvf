Biography[edit]
Guilherme was born in Rio Claro, Brazil. Along with his brother Rafael, he started jiu jitsu training through an older cousin named Thiago Mendes, who was a purple belt under Leonardo Santos. After only a few months of training Thiago recognized great potential for the two boys and took them to train with Ramon Lemos & Leonardo Santos.
Art of Jiu Jitsu Academy[edit]
After teaching many seminars, the Mendes brothers decided that they wanted to have a traditional jiu jitsu school with their own students. In July 2012, with the help of their long-time sponsor and RVCA founder, Pat Tenore, Guilherme and Rafael Mendes opened up The Art of Jiu Jitsu Academy in Costa Mesa, California.
