Early life[edit]
Vujičević was born in Sarajevo, then still part of SFR Yugoslavia, his family later fled to Gronau, Germany and close to the Dutch border, to escape the Bosnian War.[3]
Netherlands[edit]
After coming through the FC Twente youth system, he was promoted to their senior side in 2009. He was loaned to VVV-Venlo in January 2011.[4] Since joining Dutch side Heracles Almelo in summer 2012,[5] Vujičević has been plagued by injuries, being out of the team for large periods.[6]
