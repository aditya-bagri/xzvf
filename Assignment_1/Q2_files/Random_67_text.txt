Huda Naccache (Arabic: هدى نقاش‎, Hebrew: הודא נקאש‎) is a Arab-Israeli model. She was the first Arab model to appear on the cover of an Arabic language magazine in a bikini and was Israel's representative to the Miss Earth beauty pageant in Thailand in December 2011.[1][2] Naccache is nearly 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and was born in Haifa in northern Israel. A Christian, her role as an Arab model has stimulated some controversy.[3]
