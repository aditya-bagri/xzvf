Plot[edit]
Wade, Marina and Merrick smuggle goods in from America to a decadent high tech Russia in the near future. On his last job, Wade and his girlfriend are murdered by Merrick.
Realizing he might have some worth, Wade's body is brought back to life by a secret Russian military organisation. He later escapes from a hospital and, helped by Katya who is a double of Marina, goes after Merrick.
However Merrick used the money he stole to buy himself powerful new friends. It also turns out that Merrick is just a pawn in a bigger game with a group that plans on taking Russia over.
