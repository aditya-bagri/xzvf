A fighter pilot in the People's Liberation Army Air Force, he was selected to be a CNSA astronaut in 1998. He is the first Chinese astronaut to have flown on two missions: Shenzhou 7 and Shenzhou 9.
CNSA career[edit]
Jing was one of the six trainees for the Shenzhou 6 mission.

Jing was selected as commander of Shenzhou 9, becoming the first repeat traveller of the Chinese program.[4] He commanded[5] the first manned mission to dock with the first Chinese space station, Tiangong 1, and with the first female astronaut, Liu Yang. The third member of his crew was Liu Wang.[4][5] The mission was launched on 16 June 2012,[4] returning to Earth on 29 June.[6]
