The entrance and floor mural of the station.


The floor mural and fence art in this station is called "Former Location/ Contemporary Portrait" by Laura London. It depicts of several old-fashioned black and white photos that reflects of the rock-and-roll ages and their trends, including some far-scaled portrait albums from the 1960s from The Rolling Stones. The art is also at the setting where Valley College used to exist during the earlier days, now California State University Northridge. The floor mural simply depicts of the black-and-white old age symbolism.[2]
