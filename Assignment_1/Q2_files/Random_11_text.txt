Career[edit]
Military and university[edit]
Chen Quanguo is a native of Pingyu County in Zhumadian prefecture, Henan province. In December 1973, at the age of 18, Chen enlisted in the People's Liberation Army. He joined the Communist Party of China in February 1976. After leaving the military in March 1977, he briefly worked at a car parts factory in Zhumadian.[3][4]
After China resumed the National Higher Education Entrance Examination which was interrupted during the Cultural Revolution, in March 1978 Chen was admitted to the Economics Department of Zhengzhou University in the provincial capital Zhengzhou.[3][4]
Henan[edit]
Chen Quanguo graduated from Zhengzhou University in December 1981 and returned to work in his hometown of Pingyu. Starting in 1983 he worked for the prefectural government of Zhumadian, and in 1988 became the Communist Party Chief of Suiping, a county under the administration of Zhumadian. In 1994 he was appointed the head of the Organization Department of the nearby prefecture-level city of Pingdingshan.[2][3][4]
From 1995 to 1997 Chen enrolled as a part-time student at the School of Business Administration of Wuhan University of Technology, obtaining a master's degree in economics. From 1996 to 1998 he served as the Mayor and Deputy Party Chief of Luohe, another prefecture-level city in Henan.[2][3][4]
Chen Quanguo was promoted to Vice-Governor of Henan Province in January 1998, Head of the Provincial Organization Department in November 2000, and Deputy Communist Party Chief in April 2003.[2][3][4]
Hebei[edit]
In November 2009 Chen Quanguo was transferred to neighbouring Hebei and promoted to Acting Governor and Deputy Party Chief of the province. He replaced Hu Chunhua, who became the Party Chief of Inner Mongolia. In January 2010 he was officially elected by the provincial congress as Governor of Hebei.[2][3][4]
Tibet[edit]
In August 2011 Chen was transferred and promoted again, this time to remote Tibet Autonomous Region as Party Chief, the top official of the region. He replaced Zhang Qingli, who became the Party Chief of Hebei.[2][3][4] Subordinate to Chen was the Chairman (governor) of Tibet, Padma Choling, who was replaced by Losang Jamcan in January 2013.[1]
Chen Quanguo was an alternate member of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and is a full member of the 18th Central Committee.[2][3][4]
