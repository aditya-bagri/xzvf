Songkran is a term derived from the Sanskrit saṅkrānti (or, more specifically, meṣa saṅkrānti). It may refer to the traditional New Year celebrated in Thailand and several Southeast Asian countries when the sun transits the constellation of Aries, the first astrological sign in the Zodiac, as reckoned by sidereal astrology:

Cambodian New Year
Songkran (Lao)
Sinhalese New Year, in Sri Lanka
Songkran (Thailand)
Thingyan, in Myanmar
Vaisakhi, in India

Similar New Year days:

Ēostre festival days, as given by Bede
Lady Day, in olde England
Nowruz, in modern Iran and neighboring countries
Vernal Equinox Day, in modern Japan

Songkran can also refer to the traditional New Year celebrated by the Dai people of Yunnan, China, and by the Tai Dam people of northern Vietnam. Easter weekend occasionally coincides with Songkran (in Thailand, most recently in 1979, 1990, and 2001, but not again until 2085[1]).
