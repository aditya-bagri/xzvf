Two ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Solent, after the Solent, a stretch of water between the Isle of Wight and mainland England:

HMS Solent was a storeship, transferred from the War Department in 1907 and sold later that year
HMS Solent was an S-class submarine, launched in 1944 and broken up in 1961

(The name HMS Solent was used to represent a fictional destroyer, blown up by gunfire, in the 1960 war film Sink the Bismarck!).
