Potemkin City Limits is the fourth full length album by the Canadian band Propagandhi, released on October 18, 2005 through G7 Welcoming Committee Records in Canada, and Fat Wreck Chords elsewhere. It is the second Propagandhi release on their own label and the last on Fat Wreck Chords.
Guitarist/Vocalist Chris Hannah has stated that he considers "Potemkin City Limits" to be his personal favourite Propagandhi album. [5]
The title of the album is an allusion to Potemkin village, a political term referring to a false construct intended to hide an undesirable situation.
The opening track, "A Speculative Fiction," won the first annual ECHO Songwriting Prize from the Society of Composers, Authors, and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN).[6] The band pledged to use the $5000 prize to make donations to the Haiti Action Network and The Welcome Place, an organization in Winnipeg (which they'd previously done volunteer work for) which helps refugees start new lives in Manitoba.[7]
