Jacksonville Jaguars (2005–2008)[edit]
Barnes was drafted in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He started in 12 games in his rookie season, and became one of only 6 offensive linemen to start 12 or more games in his rookie season in Jaguars history. In four years with the team he started 57 of 60 games. Barnes played left tackle exclusively during his time in Jacksonville, where he typically had to face the opposing teams' best pass rushers. His run-blocking, however, was typically very good.
Oakland Raiders (2009–present)[edit]
Barnes signed a one-year contract with the Oakland Raiders on March 14, 2009.[1] He was active from week 3 to 8 of the 2009 NFL season, logging two starts at right tackle. The Raiders re-signed Barnes on March 5, 2010, and he made their 53-man roster as a guard. During the 2010 NFL season, he started 3 of 16 games. On November 7, 2010, in a game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Barnes caught his first NFL touchdown pass from Jason Campbell after reporting as an eligible receiver for a play. During the 2011 NFL season, he was the opening day right offensive tackle, replacing Langston Walker, next to guard Cooper Carlisle, helping the Raiders gain 190 rushing yards in a victory over the Denver Broncos. Has a total of 35 false starts in the NFL.
Barnes was resigned to a new contract on February 28, 2014, allowing him to stay with the Raiders.[2]
Personal[edit]
Family Life[edit]
On July 7, 2012, Khalif married Talia Wright of Jacksonville, Florida. Together they have a son and a daughter.
Legal troubles[edit]

The license plate on the Barnes' 2007 silver Mercedes had also expired. He spent several hours in the Duval County jail before being released on $500 bond. Barnes was benched for the next game against the Houston Texans. On July 11 Barnes was sentenced to six months probation, pay $650 in fines and court costs, perform 50 hours of community service, attend a drunken driving class and have his driver's license suspended for six months.
