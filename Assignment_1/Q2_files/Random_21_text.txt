Critical reception[edit]
The New York Times described the film in 1934 as a "highly interesting production...Brigitte Helm, the versatile German actress, is the centre of the story...Her work is up to the high standard she has established in several foreign language pictures that have reached New York. Albert Bassermann, one of Germany's best veteran actors, is excellent as the scientist whose efforts to emulate the wonder-workers of the ancient days bring so much trouble upon nearly all involved in the affair, regardless of their innocence or guilt. The support is first class...Although this picture was made almost four years ago, the sound reproduction and photography are clear. The direction is competent." [2]
