History[edit]
The group was created in 1986 in Sofia by talented students from the National Academy of Music and the University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy. The group first live performance was on December 22, 1986.[1]
In 1989 Ahat released their first album Pohodut (Походът, The March. All songs from the album are absolute hits. The most famous are: "The Black Sheep", "Land Of Blindmen", "The Tree", "Fiery Souls", "The March". They also received their first music award and had a very successful tour with Shturcite. The following year, they appeared on the compilation "21st Youth Pop Song Contest" with the song "Deviz" (Девиз, Motto).
In 1994 the band released their second album Izpod ruinite (Изпод руините, Underneath the Ruins). The album is a compilation of the band's hits, a couple of songs recorded for compilations and 5 English-language songs recorded in 1991. Notable songs from this album are "Monologue" and the English version of "The Tree". After a period of inactivity, the band had a very notable return being the opening band for the first Deep Purple concert in Bulgaria in 1998. The next year, the band released their first live album Sedem godini sled (Седем години след, 7 Years Later).
On May 19, 2004 the band released their third album, Made in USA. According to the publishers the album is the biggest investment made by Bulgarian musical producer.[2]
