"Do You" is a 2007 single by American singer-songwriter Ne-Yo. It is about Ne-Yo questioning his ex-girlfriend if she ever thinks about him anymore. It is the second single from his second album, Because of You. The single was officially released to radio the week of June 12, 2007. In an interview with BET, Ne-Yo said that "Do You" is the second part to his song "So Sick" from his debut album, In My Own Words.
"Do You" was released on July 30 in UK as a download only single, despite receiving more video play than follow-up single "Can We Chill" (which received a physical release), resulting in a lower chart position of number 100 there, his lowest charting single.[1]
Ne-Yo premiered "Do You" on BET's Access Granted on May 23, 2007.

Remixes[edit]
Two duet remixes of the song have been released, both versions featuring the female singer singing the second verse with different lyrics: one with fellow American R&B singer Mary J. Blige and the other with Japanese American pop singer Hikaru Utada. Utada's version was released digitally in Japan on November 21, 2007 as her 7th English single (her 27th single overall). The version with Utada was included on the Ne-Yo: The Collection Japanese compilation.
Music video[edit]
The video was directed by Melina Matsoukas.
First Ne-Yo is seen in a car fighting with his ex-girlfriend, who then leaves the car. Ne-Yo is trying to write a letter to his ex, asking if she remembers him. It is seemingly difficult, as he crumples up paper and throws them away. His ex has moved on, getting engaged, and gave birth to a baby girl. His ex is then shown on a couch kissing her new boyfriend, and lying on his lap, at the same time distant. Ne-Yo then remembers a memory where he is kissing his ex on the same couch. Ne-Yo is then driving and stops at a pay phone, and calls his ex to come to the pay phone. But by the time she arrives, he has already left. At the end she imagines herself reuniting with Ne-Yo, picturing them kissing, hugging, and caressing.
