Gameplay[edit]
The player becomes head of operations in a fictional rescue management organization in command of a number of vehicles and staff from the fire department medical rescue police and technical services. The player has to react to a variety of events against a background of continuous day/night rotation and constantly changing weather conditions.[2][3]
The game includes 20 missions, the ability to manage a team of emergency response professionals, ability to manage a variety of emergency response vehicles, with mandatory free play intermissions at every interim, and the Endless and Challenge free play modes.[2][3][4][5]
Emergency 4 boasts several improvements in user-friendliness over previous games in the Emergency series. For instance, it is possible to dispatch several vehicles at the same time, order them to arrive at a specific location, there's a simple counter for the number of casualties in the area of operations, and idle emergency physicians seek out nearby untended casualties.
A deluxe release includes three extra missions and support for voice commands.
