William "Billy" Brown (22 August 1900 in Hetton-le-Hole, County Durham – January 1985 in Easington, County Durham) was an English professional footballer.
Brown joined West Ham United, a club he'd played for as a 16-year-old during World War I,[1] from Hetton in 1921. He made his debut in the final match of the 1920-21 season, a scoreless away game against South Shields on 7 May 1921.
Brown often featured as a utility player, but played inside-right, partnering Dick Richards, in the 1923 FA Cup Final against Bolton Wanderers. A month later, he played for England in a reserve international against France. He gained a full cap against Belgium at The Hawthorns the following year.
He made 71 appearances and scored 20 goals for the east London club before leaving for Chelsea in 1924. He went on to play for Fulham, Stockport County and Hartlepools United. He later became an accomplished cricket player for Blackhall Colliery Welfare in the North Yorkshire South Durham league.
Notes[edit]
