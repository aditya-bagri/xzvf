Yishun MRT Station (NS13) is an elevated Mass Rapid Transit station in Singapore. It is the northernmost of two stations serving Yishun New Town and is part of the North South Line. The station used to be the terminus of the line between 1988 and 1996 until the North South Line Woodlands Extension was completed and opened on 10 February 1996. But currently, certain train services would terminate at this station for the short trip between Yishun and Marina Bay, which only operates during morning peak hours and early evening hours for weekdays, and late evening hours for weekdays and Saturdays. Its station colour is green and blue.
Yishun opened in December 1988, two years earlier than planned and during the start of construction in December 1984, Nee Soon North was renamed to Yishun and Nee Soon South was renamed to Khatib. Before the underpass link to Northpoint was completed in 1993, there was a pedestrian crossing that linked the station and bus interchange.

History[edit]
Bomb plot[edit]
On 22 December 2001, the Singapore embassies attack plot was discovered, and had included plans to bomb Yishun MRT Station at several points, including the sewers near the station. This was brought up in a debate during a session of the parliament, by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, during which new security measures were proposed, especially on the MRT system itself.[1]
Bomb hoax[edit]
On 19 January 2008 at about 1530 hours (SST), a call was made from a public telephone at the MRT Station alleging that there was a bomb at the station.[2] Police arrested a 31-year-old Chinese man believed to be linked to the crime on 23 February 2008 at 1600 hours. The man was charged on 25 February 2008 for transmitting a false message that makes reference to a bomb.[3]
Platform screen doors[edit]
Yishun, Pasir Ris and Jurong East were the first stations to undergo testing as to whether the platform screen doors were viable for elevated stations. Eventually, installation of the half-height platform screen doors started on 26 August 2009 and operations commenced on 2 December 2009. It was the second above-ground station to have half-height platform screen doors installed and commence operations, after Pasir Ris. After the tests were successful, it was become the first North-South Line station to have the half-height doors. Half-height screen doors have been installed in all elevated stations.
High volume, low speed (HVLS) fans[edit]
Yishun is the first station in northern Singapore to have High Volume, Low Speed (HVLS) fans installed which have been in operation as of 27 June 2012.
