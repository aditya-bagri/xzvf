Earthquake
At 5.30am on 23 September 2000 Budbrooke was the epicentre of one of the largest earthquakes recorded the 21st century in the UK. The earthquake measured 4.2 on the Richter Scale[3] and caused little damage.[4]
Transport
Budbrooke is close to the A46 which runs to the east of the parish. This leads to Coventry in the northbound direction, and to junction 15 of the M40 in the southbound direction. Access to nearby Warwick is provided by both the A425 and A4189.
Warwick Parkway railway station is located within Budbrooke parish, which is operated by Chiltern Railways. Located about half a mile north-east of Hampton Magna, it provides direct rail services to both London and Birmingham, via the Chiltern Main Line. The station primarily serves as a park and ride facility for the wider area, but is also used by local residents.
The nearest main airport is Birmingham International Airport, West Midlands which is 17 miles away. The smaller Coventry Airport is also 10 miles away.
The 68 bus route operated by Stagecoach serves the village. There are half hourly journeys to Hatton, Parkway station, Warwick, Leamington Spa and Cubbington.[5]
