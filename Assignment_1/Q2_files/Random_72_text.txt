Queen's Plate (1961)


Last updated on February 18, 2010


Blue Light (foaled 1958 in Ontario) was a Canadian Thoroughbred racehorse who showed little promise as a two-year-old in 1960 but who won the 1961 Queen's Plate, Canada's most prestigious race and North America's oldest annually run stakes race.[1]
Bred by E. P. Taylor, Blue Light was sired by Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Chop Chop. His dam, Blen Lark, was a daughter of Blenheim, the 1930 Epsom Derby winner and Leading sire in North America in 1941. Blue Light was purchased and raced by eighty-one-year-old Col. Kenric R. Marshall, a decorated World War I soldier who later commanded the 48th Highlanders of Canada, who was a highly successful businessman. A long time participant in the Canadian racing industry, Marshall served as Chairman of the Ontario Jockey Club and owned 1957 Canadian Horse of the Year, Hartney.
