The Witty Sorcerer, also known as Zuo ci xi cao, is a 1931 Hong Kong historical comedy-drama film, directed by Lai Pak-hoi. It was released on 14 March 1931 after Lai's other film The Pain of Separation and starred Lai himself and Xu Menghen.[1] It is based on a story in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms about Zuo Ci playing tricks on Cao Cao (played by Lai Pak-hoi). It was one of the earliest locally filmed Hong Kong feature films to become successful on a grand scale.[2]
