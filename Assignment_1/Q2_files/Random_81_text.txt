Chart performance[edit]
The single was released on 31 March 2008 as both a CD single and as two alternate 7" singles. It managed to enter the UK Singles Chart at a peak of #19, making it 'The Courteeners' most successful single to date.
Lyrical Meaning[edit]
The lyrics concern a conversation between a young man and his older girlfriend, who is disappointed by his wild and hedonistic behaviour that night, and she drives him for 'tea and toast'. He flirts with her in the car, but she reminds him he's only young and needs to get his life together. He goes out again and chases another woman, but she disappears before he can make conversation. He muses about how she probably wasn't worth chasing before understanding his girlfriend's words.
