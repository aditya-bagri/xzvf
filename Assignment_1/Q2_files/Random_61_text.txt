Release and promotion[edit]
On March 16, 2015, the album pre-order appeared on the iTunes Store without prior announcement,[3] in part due to an error by Sony Music Entertainment.[4] On March 17, 2015, Earl released a music video for the song "Grief".[5] The full album was digitally released on March 23, 2015, and the physical version was released later on April 14, 2015.[6] In August of the same year, Sweatshirt released an animated music video for the song "Off Top".[7]

Upon its release, I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside: An Album by Earl Sweatshirt received widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album has received an average score of 81, indicating "universal acclaim", based on 31 reviews.[8] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, "I Don't Like Shit is heavy and lacks much hope, and yet it communicates these feelings with such skill and artful understanding that it still fills the soul."[9] Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times said, "Within these sparse, Rothko-esque works the artist dedicates deep, unflinching energy to documenting and hopefully exorcising his woes (or at least understanding them), delivering lines with wondrous cadence, zipping with a sing-song musicality that illuminates what surrounds it."[15] Winston Cook-Wilson of Pitchfork Media said, "From the first bars of the swaggering organ-driven opener 'Huey', it feels like the realization of a voice that, in some sense, he's had an APB out on since his first record.[...]Earl is carefully whittling away at the proclivities he's always had, remaining confident that he'll light upon something that feels fresh and honest. So far, he's right."[16] In a positive review for Exclaim!, Erin Lowers praised Earl's "raw and honest" look at both sides of success.[12] Tshepo Mokoena of The Guardian said, "The album staggers by quickly, making it easy to miss a lacerating line here or clever double entendre there. In that respect, it lends itself well to multiple listens."[13]
Eric Diep of HipHopDX said, "His self-expression is supported by an album mostly produced by him (a.k.a.. randomblackdude) and Left Brain, where the entire production is minimal, dark and contains rare interludes. It's the glue that holds all his confessions and retrospective bars together."[14] Don Dolan of Rolling Stone said, "It's amazing that music so claustrophobic can be this engrossing."[17] Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club said, "At just under a half hour, it's even more understated than its predecessor, with fewer guests, almost no outside producers, less variety--less everything, really. That may sound like a downgrade, but it's not, since here the anti-spectacle becomes a kind of spectacle of its own, as Earl tests how far his music can retreat into itself."[10] Rachel Chesbrough of XXL said, "Nothing is forced in his rhymes; his lyricism is so dense and acrobatic that his freestyle vibe is all the more impressive."[18]
