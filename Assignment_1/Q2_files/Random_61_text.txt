George Tiernay Mirehouse (11 May 1863 – 5 March 1923) was an English cricketer who appeared in 13 first-class cricket matches for Cambridge University, Somerset and the Marylebone Cricket Club in the 1880s. Primarily a right-arm medium-fast bowler, Mirehouse took 22 first-class wickets at an average of 27.54.
Life and career[edit]
Born in St George's Hill, Easton-in-Gordano, Somerset, George Tiernay Mirehouse was the second son of Henry John and Anne (née Roche), and was named for his maternal grandfather.[1] He attended Westminster School, and played for the school's cricket team, appearing for the side against Charterhouse School in 1880.[2] He then attended Jesus College, Cambridge University.[3] He played seven first-class matches for the university,[4] but did not appear in the Varsity Match against Oxford University.[5] Mirehouse achieved his best performance in first-class cricket for Cambridge, claiming four wickets in the second innings for the university against CI Thornton's XI.[6] He also appeared a number of times for both Somerset and the Marylebone Cricket Club.[5]
Mirehouse emigrated to Turramurra, Sydney where he ran a sugar refinery. On 5 March 1923, a few days after voicing concerns about business matters, he hanged himself from his bed with a sash-cord.[7]
