Football career[edit]
Early years / Rayo[edit]
Born in the capital of Madrid, Amaya began his football career at local San Cristóbal de los Ángeles. He joined another team in the community, Rayo Vallecano, in 2002, also serving a six-month loan spell at lowly UD San Sebastián de los Reyes in Segunda División B.
Eventually Amaya returned to Rayo, becoming an important defensive unit for the side which returned to Segunda División at the end of the 2007–08 season and comfortably maintained its league status the following campaign, with the player appearing in less than half of the games (18 out of 42).
Wigan[edit]
Amaya signed for Premier League team Wigan Athletic on a three-year contract on 14 August 2009,[1] being joined at the club by Rayo teammate Mohamed Diamé a week later.[2] He made his debut in a 1–4 defeat at Blackpool in the season's Football League Cup on the 26th, scoring his team's goal with a header in stoppage time.[3]
After failing to make a single league appearance in 2009–10, Amaya returned to former club Rayo, in a season-long loan.[4] He was regularly used as the club returned to La Liga after an eight-year absence.
Betis[edit]
On 18 July 2011 Wigan announced the departure of Amaya, who signed a three-year contract with Real Betis.[5]
He scored his first goal for the club on 1 December 2013, in a 2–2 home draw against former club Rayo.[6]
Return to Rayo[edit]
In early June 2014, following Betis' top flight relegation, Amaya once again returned to Rayo Vallecano.[7] He finished his first season in his second spell with 19 games and one goal,[8] helping the side easily avoid relegation.
On 20 December 2015, Amaya was on target at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, but his team had to play with nine players for more than 60 minutes and were eventually crushed 2–10 by hosts Real Madrid.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Amaya's older brother, Iván, is also a footballer and a central defender. Both represented local Rayo.[10][11]
