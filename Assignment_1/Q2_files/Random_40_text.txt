Clinton Voss (born 11 October 1979) is an Australian television actor. He is best known for his role as Kelvin Crump in the children's television series Ship to Shore.
Voss was born in Brisbane, Queensland, and educated in Western Australia. He was a member of Clyde Selby's North Lake Theatre before landing a role in The Sharp Detective Agency playing Jackie, younger brother to a character played by Isla Fisher. The ill-fated show had funding problems from German-based investors and was subsequently dropped by its producer, Nomad Films. The show later surfaced in Queensland as Bay City. Clinton, his agent John Low, and his now-retired wife Veronica Overton were then left with a decision; move to Queensland or take the role as Kelvin Crump in Ship to Shore, produced by Paul Barron. Clinton was a finalist 'Young Australian of the Year' and awarded an 'Outstanding Achievement in the Area of the Arts' award.
Ship to Shore's creators David Rapsey and his writer brother John Rapsey also favoured Clinton for such roles as 'Snowy Bowles', a gay cyclist in the series Sweat played by Heath Ledger. Controversy surrounded this decision as Ledger was set to play 'Kelvin' in Ship to Shore; however BBC, Nine Network and ABC executives saw it differently. Subsequent negotiations saw Ledger play opposite Voss in only a few episodes of Ship to Shore and a rematch was never to be.
Voss has appeared in several advertisements and other television series including Halifax f.p.. Ship to Shore was seen in over a hundred countries and negotiations to release DVD box sets of the series have so far failed.
Clinton now resides in New South Wales and works for Headspace after completing his postgraduate studies as a psychologist. Clinton remains a passionate advocate for young people who experience mental health related challenges.
