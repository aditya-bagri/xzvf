The Beech Street Brick Street is an historic section of the Beech Street roadway in Texarkana, Arkansas. It consists of a section of road, between 14th and 24th Streets, which was paved in brick c. 1904. It is a residential road located northeast of Texarkana's downtown, and is about 3,425 feet (1,044 m) long and 23 feet (7.0 m) wide. The bricks, which measure 4 by 8.5 inches (10 by 22 cm), are laid in a running bond pattern. The road section is a rare surviving example of the use of brick as a paving material, as most such roads have since been paved over with asphalt.[2]
The road section was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.[1] It contributes to the historic significance of the Beech Street Historic District, which includes the residential properties on Beech Street and some adjacent roads.[3]
