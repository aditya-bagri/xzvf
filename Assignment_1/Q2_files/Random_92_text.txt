Harvey Kuenn's plaque on the Brewers Walk of Fame


The Milwaukee Brewers Walk of Fame was established by the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team in 2001 with the opening of Miller Park. Although the Milwaukee Brewers do not have an official Hall of Fame, the honor of induction into the Walk is considered to be the equivalent. Each member of the Walk is honored with a home plate-shaped granite slab, featuring the member's name and signature, as well as years associated with Milwaukee. The slabs are arranged around Miller Park, circling the stadium and culminating with the Hank Aaron and Robin Yount statues in front of the home plate area of the park. Through 2015, 17 members of the Milwaukee Brewers have been inducted.
The voting process involves approximately 100 Wisconsin media members and Brewers officials. In 2007, a second ballot featuring members of Milwaukee Braves was also sent to voters. To be elected, nominees must receive 75% of the vote from all ballots received. Individuals must receive at least 5% of the vote to remain eligible in future years. Induction is limited only to players and officials who spend at least three years in Milwaukee.[1]
