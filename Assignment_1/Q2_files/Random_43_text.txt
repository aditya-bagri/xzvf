The John Lohmar House is a historic house in the Near North neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. It has several features common to Queen Anne style architecture, such as a wraparound Doric colonnade porch, a knob and spindle balustrade, and a bracketed cornice. Its owner, John Lohmar, was a merchant and milliner of German ancestry. Descendants of the original owner lived in the house until 1971 and preserved its original appearance as a single-family house.[2] The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
