Lucy Ann Johnson (born October 14, 1935) is an American-Canadian woman who was reported missing in May 1965, after not having been seen since September 1961. She was found alive in July 2013[2] after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police reopened the investigation into Johnson's disappearance.[1][3]
Disappearance[edit]
Johnson was an Alaska native who was living in Surrey, British Columbia with her husband Marvin and their two children, Linda and Daniel.[4] She was last seen alive by a neighbour in September 1961. She was finally reported missing by her husband Marvin on May 14, 1965, who admitted she actually had gone missing years earlier. Her husband was suspected of her murder; he was interrogated and the family garden was dug up, but no evidence was found. The trail went cold and Marvin remarried and died in the 1990s.[5]
Rediscovery[edit]
In June 2013, her daughter Linda Evans placed a newspaper ad, asking the public for help in her mother's disappearance. She received a reply from a woman named Rhonda[6] from Whitehorse, Yukon, who claimed that Lucy Johnson was her mother. Johnson was eventually discovered alive and well in Yukon. She had remarried and had an additional four children.[5]
Johnson said she had disappeared because her husband Marvin was abusive. She tried to take the children with her, but he would not allow it.[7]
