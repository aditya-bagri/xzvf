The Legislative Office Building of the New Hampshire State Legislature, formerly a federal government post office facility, is located on North State Street, between Capitol and Park streets, across North State Street from the New Hampshire State House in Concord, New Hampshire.[2] The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Old Post Office.[1]
The main portion of the Victorian two-story granite building was built between 1884 and 1889 for the federal government to a design by James Riggs Hill, the United States Treasury Department's Supervising Architect. The building was twice extended, in 1913 and 1938. When first built, it housed not only the post office, but other federal offices and the federal district court. The federal government occupied the building until 1967.[3] The building was afterward acquired by the state and converted for use as legislative offices.[2]
The building was listed on the National Register in 1973, and included in the Concord Civic District in 1983.[2]
