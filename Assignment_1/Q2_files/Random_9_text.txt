Intercalated Games


1906


Canada competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States. Canada returned to the Summer Games after having participated in the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. 408 competitors, 257 men and 151 women, took part in 193 events in 23 sports.[1]
Primarily due to the Soviet Union-led boycott of these Games, Canada enjoyed its best-ever results at the Summer Games, coming in sixth place in the number of Gold medals won, and fourth place in the total medals won - double their second best total in 1996.
