History[edit]
Drama Kids (2001–2004)[edit]
SouthFM's first album Drama Kids was originally released by Dallas-based indie label Brando Records, and later re-released nationally by MCA.[1][2] The lead single, Dear Claudia, received good airplay in the U.S. and was included in an episode of Law & Order SVU. Ken Shimamoto of the Fort Worth Weekly said Paco Estrada's "pipes are strong and expressive enough to set him apart from the other 10,000 faceless, droning alt-rock angst-boys."[1] MCA closed its doors while SouthFM was touring in support of Drama Kids, leaving the band and album behind. Many MCA artists were merged into Geffen Records, SouthFM however, was released from their contract.
Swallowing the Pill (2005–2006)[edit]
After nearly two years of writing since parting ways with MCA/Geffen the band released their follow up album, Swallowing The Pill, yet again on Brando Records.[3] Two singles were officially released to radio, "Killing Me" and "Blue & Grey". The band toured regionally throughout 2005 and 2006, until their final show on October 28, 2006 at the Curtain Club in Dallas, Texas.
June 12, 2010 Reunion (2010)[edit]
After nearly four years of silence, Dallas-based rock band SouthFM returns this Spring to make some noise. The band will release Letters That Were Never Sent, a rarities collection of over fifty unreleased recordings beginning April 1, and reunite for one night only on June 12, 2010 at the Curtain Club in Dallas, Texas.
Letters That Were Never Sent (2010)[edit]
Letters That Were Never Sent is a 3 part digital compilation album of demos, live, and rare recordings by SouthFM. The majority of the songs were written/recorded leading up to the releases of Drama Kids and Swallowing The Pill prior to 2005. Some of thes songs ended up being re-recorded professionally for the actual albums while others were never released.
November Shows (2010)[edit]
SouthFM gathered again in November 2010 to play three shows. This time they were not joined by original guitarist, G.I. Sanders. Dan Rivera, a friend of the band, filled in on guitar. They were scheduled to play in three Texas cities, Dallas, Tyler, and San Antonio, which was cancelled due to an illness. November 20, 2010 at The Venue @ The Down Under Pub in Tyler, Texas, and the following weekend on November 27, 2010 at Trees in Dallas, Texas. Opening for SouthFM that night was Mothers Anthem, Eyes Burn Electric and Meridian.
Reformation (2011-)[edit]
During SXSW 2011, Paco Estrada played a show with Ryan Holley and Matt Noveskey of A+ Machines. A+ Machines used to play shows with SouthFM, and Ryan Holley had provided vocals on SouthFM's song "Regret / The Grieving" on the Swallowing the Pill album. The musicians enjoyed the show so much that they decided to form a new band together, along with drummer Alphonso Lovelace. The new band was called Lambs to Lions, and their sound was very similar to SouthFM. The group would periodically meet at Noveskey's recording studio in Austin to write and rehearse new songs. All of the members were involved in other musical projects, and over time it became clear that Noveskey would not have time to devote to the band. The group recruited SouthFM's bassist Dave Shafer and guitarist Chad Abbott, and decided to transform Lambs to Lions into a new incarnation of SouthFM. They are currently writing their next album, which they plan to record in 2016.
Band members[edit]
Founding members Paco Estrada (vocals),[4] G.I. Sanders (guitar), and Chad Abbott (guitar), were the mainstays for the band, performing on every recording and at every show during the band's existence. Dave Shafer (bass) and Tabber Millard (drums) were also members of the band at the end. Other members included Moe Martinez (drums), Doug McGrath (bass), Spencer Estep (drums), and Scot Risch (bass).
