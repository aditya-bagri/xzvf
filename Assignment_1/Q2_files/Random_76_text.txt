History[edit]
The constituency was created by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 for the 1885 general election, when the former two-seat Wolverhampton constituency was divided into three single-member constituencies.
It was abolished for the 1950 general election, when it was largely replaced by the new Wolverhampton South West constituency.
Boundaries[edit]
1885–1918[edit]
The original boundaries of the constituency were set in the sixth schedule of the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. The seat comprised five wards of the municipal borough of Wolverhampton (St. Mark's, St. Paul's, St. John's, St. George's and St. Matthew's) and the neighbouring Ettingshall area which lay outside the borough boundaries.[1]
1918-1950[edit]
Constituencies throughout Great Britain were redrawn by the Representation of the People Act 1918. Wolverhampton's municipal boundaries had been enlarged and it had become a county borough in the period since 1885. The Wolverhampton West seat was redefined to reflect this, and was described as comprising nine wards of the county borough: Blakenhall, Dunstall, Graiseley, Merridale, Park, St. George's, St. John's, St. Mark's and St. Matthew's.[2]
