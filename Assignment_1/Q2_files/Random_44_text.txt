Newshour is BBC World Service's flagship international news and current affairs radio programme, which broadcasts twice daily (each edition being broadcast twice): at 1300/1400 and 2000/2100 (GMT) each edition lasting one hour. It consists of news bulletins on the hour and half hour, international interviews and in-depth reports of world news. The World Service consider it to be one of their most important strands, as shown in 2011 when it was kept as one of four key outlets. It is also heard in the United States on various American Public Media member stations. The programme comes live from Broadcasting House in London, offering analysis and background on the major news of the day, often interviewing heads of state and government ministers.

History[edit]
Newshour is a long running strand of the BBC's World Service which began broadcasting in 1988. [1] The programme broadcasts twice daily, although each broadcast has in turn two editions. Therefore, the early afternoon edition broadcasts at both 12pm and 2pm (UK time) with each edition aimed at different sections of the world. The 2pm broadcast is heard on various Public Radio Stations in the United States at 9am. Newshour's second daily programme broadcasts at 8pm and 9pm (UK time). [2] Presenter, Owen Bennett-Jones claims, "Newshour is intended to provide detailed coverage of the world. We try to provide a level of analysis that's not readily available elsewhere." [3]
