The Tofaş Museum of Cars and Anatolian Carriages (Turkish: Tofaş Anadolu Arabaları Müzesi) is a private transport museum in Bursa, Turkey owned by the Turkish automobile maker Tofaş and dedicated to various carriages (Turkish: Araba) from Turkey and Tofaş-manufactured cars.[1][2] It was opened on June 30, 2002.[3]
Situated in the historic Umurbey neighborhood of Yıldırım district, the museum is housed in a renovated building of 17,000 m2 (180,000 sq ft) that was an abandoned silk production plant. The facility was leased to the Bursa-based Tofaş Company for museum purposes by the Metropolitan Municipality of Bursa.[1][2][4]
