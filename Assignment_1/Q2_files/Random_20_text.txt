Overview[edit]
Nennig is known for a Roman villa containing well-preserved mosaics that were excavated in the 19th century. The village was a condominium of the Trier bishopric, Lorraine (the Kingdom of France from 1766) and Luxembourg until its annexation by Revolutionary France in 1794. During the Second World War Nennig was almost completely destroyed as the village changed hands several times in late-1944 and early-1945.
