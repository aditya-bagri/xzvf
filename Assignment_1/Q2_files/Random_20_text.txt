Production[edit]
A remake of the film was reported to be in the planning stages in 2012, with Tom Cruise starring. It was reported that Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, and Matt Damon might join the film.[1] On December 4, 2014, Chris Pratt was in early talks to join Washington in the film.[2] On February 20, 2015, Haley Bennett was set to star as the widow of a man who was murdered, and she hires seven bounty hunters to get revenge.[3] Peter Sarsgaard signed on on May 20, 2015, to play the villain role in the film.[4] On the same day, Deadline's Mike Fleming Jr confirmed that Jason Momoa had left the film because he was already booked to play Aquaman.[5] On July 11, 2015, Daily Mirror reported that Vinnie Jones had been set to star in the film.[6]
James Horner was pegged to write the film's score, but died on June 22, 2015. In July 2015, nearly a month after Horner's death, Fuqua learned that the score already had been written, and Horner had planned for it to be a surprise.[7]
Filming[edit]
Principal photography on the film lasted 64 days, from March 18 to August 18, 2015, in the north of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. [8][9][10] Other locations include St. Francisville and Zachary, Louisiana.[9][9][10] Filming in St. Francisville was completed between May 18 and May 29, 2015.[11]
Release[edit]
On March 29, 2015, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer set the film for the MLK, Jr. weekend, January 13, 2017.[12] However, in August 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment moved the film up for a release on September 23, 2016.[13]
