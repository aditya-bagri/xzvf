A photonic chip uses light instead of electricity and is being developed for the "production of ultra-fast quantum computers with capabilities far beyond todayâ€™s devices." The Financial Times stated that with the chip "data can be processed according to the counterintuitive rules of quantum physics that allow individual subatomic particles to be in several places at the same time" and that: "Future quantum computers will, for example, be able to pull important information out of the biggest databases almost instantaneously."
