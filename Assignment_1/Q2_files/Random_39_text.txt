Kimilsungia is the namesake flower of Kim Il-sung.


Kim Il-sung was the founder and first leader of North Korea. Jane Portal, the author of Art Under Control in North Korea, assesses that: "[i]t is probably the case that Kim Il-sung [had] more buildings named after him during his lifetime than any other leader in history".[1] North Korea claims that "[m]ore than 480 streets, institutions and organizations in 100 countries were named after Kim Il Sung".[2] Since Kim Il-sung's name Il-sung can mean "the Sun", many things named after him are actually called this way.[3]
