The Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board (SWLSB, French: Commission scolaire Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier, CSSWL) is a school board headquartered in Rosemère, Quebec in Greater Montreal.
It officially came into existence in July 1998 when English language schools from eight former school boards were amalgamated. Laurenval School Board, Laurentian School Board and Laurentienne School Trustees were merged, and the English sector of the other school boards of the Laval, Laurentides and Lanaudière administrative regions joined to form the new administrative entity.
The Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board is the third largest English school board in the Province of Quebec, Canada.
