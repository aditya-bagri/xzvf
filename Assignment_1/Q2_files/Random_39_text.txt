Synopsis[edit]
Sirens focused on the work and lives of three rookie female Pittsburgh Police officers. Officer Sarah Berkezchuk (Jayne Brook) is dealing with her failing marriage, Officer Lynn Stanton (Adrienne-Joi Johnson) is a single mom, and second-generation cop Officer Molly Whelan (Liza Snyder) has a bad attitude which starts to interfere with her job. Each rookie officer worked under a veteran cop, and each grows and becomes more focused as a result. A few episodes into the syndicated series Molly Whelan is taken under the wing of detective Lt. Lyle Springer (J. H. Wyman) and slowly learns the ropes of detective work, and becomes a stand-up policewoman.
Despite receiving an Emmy nomination, the series was canceled by ABC after 13 episodes, but was picked up in syndication the following year, with 24 episodes being produced and aired. Sirens' syndicated run featured a slightly different cast, with Adrienne-Joi Johnson and Liza Snyder reprising their lead roles, and Jayne Heitmeyer replacing Jayne Brook, but was still set in Pittsburgh.[1]
This TV formula, while not a success with Sirens, has been retooled into 2010's Rookie Blue, which like Sirens is predominately filmed in Canada. CBS' NYC 22 (2012) used a similar set-up, but like Sirens was also not a success.
