Synopsis[edit]
The film's plot was a collection of highlights from the novel, such as

"The Convict Mutiny in the 'Malabar'",
"The Burning of the 'Hydaspes'",
"The Murder on Hampstead Heath",
"The Solitary of Grummet Island", and
"The Life and Death Struggle Between Gabbett and his Famished Escapees".

The movie kept the tragic ending of the novel, with Rufus Dawes and Sylvia perishing in a storm after Reverend North had helped Dawes escape.[4][5]

Production[edit]
The MacMahon brothers, James and Charles MacMahon, had enjoyed success producing a version of the novel on stage,[6] and allocated a considerable budget for the movie, including a shooting schedule of eight weeks[7] and location work in Port Arthur. The scene involving the burning of a sailing ship was staged with a model ship in a tank.[2]
Reception[edit]
Based on a popular stage adaptation of the novel, the movie was a big success at the box office, running for eight weeks in Sydney at Queens Hall in 1908.[8][9] It played in cinemas on and off until World War I.[10][11] Screenings were usually accompanied by an actor, who would provide descriptive commentary to what was on screen.[12]
